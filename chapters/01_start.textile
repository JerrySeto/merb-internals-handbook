h1. Start.

There are couple of open source Merb book attempts but they all explain
how to use Merb. As occasional Merb contributor I always wanted a book that
really saves my time when it comes to understanding how things work inside
of the framework. Merb is meant to be highly hackable after all.

So I decided to write this little book about Merb internals.

h2. Foreword.

* Hacker's framework needs hacker's handbook.
	 
h2. What happens when you run merb executable.

* Start.
* Arguments parsing.
* Server start.
* Framework boot.

h2. Then request comes in.

* Merb on Rack.
* Rackup.
* Dispatch.
* Filters
* Sessions.
* MIME formats and what's behind "provides API".
* Rendering overview.
* Template inlining.
* Router internals.
* Merb application server in details.
* Plugins.
