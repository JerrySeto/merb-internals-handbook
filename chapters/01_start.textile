h1. Start.

There are a couple of open source Merb book attempts, but they all explain
how to use Merb. As an occasional Merb contributor, I always wanted a book that
really saves me time when it comes to understanding how things work inside
of the framework. Merb is meant to be highly hackable, after all.

So I decided to write this little book about Merb internals.

h2. Foreword.

* Hacker's framework needs a hacker's handbook.

h2. What happens when you run the <tt>merb</tt> executable.
